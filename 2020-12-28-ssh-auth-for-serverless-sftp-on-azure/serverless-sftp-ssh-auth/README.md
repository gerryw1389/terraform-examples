### Work In Progress (WIP)

This is still a work in progress. If you really want to see how this Logic App will look once deployed, search for `{{` and replace everything you find that matches it with replacement values.

Example: Replace `{{some-email-address}}` with `gerry@domain.com`. For those in the connections section, you will have to [create a connection first](https://automationadmin.com/2021/02/migrating-logic-apps/) for the Logic App to work as intended.
